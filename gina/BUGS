- CLM:
  If a Lisp error occurs in a callback that is triggered by a request, the
  message "Unexpected confirmation message" occurs. Example: error in
  map-callback following a pop-up request. No trivial fix, but application
  continues normally.

- CLM:
  The include file lisp.h should be renamed, because it conflicts with the
  Allegro-supplied file. If the Allegro file is not found, the error is
  not immediately apparent.

--------------------

- IB:
  create-instance should use the current size in the view-constructors.

  window in one step, feedback in the foreign window is not erased (no
  notice that target has been left).
