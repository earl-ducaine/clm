===========================================================
This directory contains some bug-reports and fixes for
bugs we detected in Allegro4.0 and Lucid4.0 while testing 
GINA. You should try if you can reproduce the errors and 
ask your Lisp vendor for the patches if necessary. 
===========================================================

Allegro4.0:
-----------
* Without patch15, the Interface Builder runs into an error 
  described in the file allegro4.0-bug15.
* The file allegro4.0-bug16 describes a performance problem.
* Without patch70 and patch75 GINA demos using multiple processes 
  do not run correctly.
  The performace problem of the function DIRECTORY is not yet solved.
  Therefore, the OPEN/SAVE dialogs of GINA are still somewhat slow.

You can load the patches allegro4.0-patch*.fasl if you have a Sun4. 
Otherwise try to reproduce the error described in  allegro4.0-bug* 
and send a bug report to Allegro.

Lucid4.0:
---------
In Lucid the bug is more crucial: No callbacks are set for Motif widgets
because after deamons are not executed. This bug is described in lucid-bug1.
You can try the minimal test to reproduce the error. You have to ask Lucid 
for a bug fix if the error occurs in your version. We received a comple new
clos.sbin from Lucid.
