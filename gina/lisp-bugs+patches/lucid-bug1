After-deamons for accessor functions are not always called in Lucid4.0. 
For example, GINA sets callbacks for a push-button by something like
  
    (setf (activate-callback button1) ....)

This sets the slot but also activates an after deamon which tells
the CLM-server about the callback. But this deamon is not called
in Lucid4.0. And so there are no callbacks at all.

To prove this I have made a minimal test:

   (defclass label-1 ()
       ((slot-1 :accessor slot-1 :initform 1)))

   (DEFMETHOD (SETF slot-1) :AFTER (NEW-value (X label-1))
           (format t "hello-1~%"))

   (setq l1 (make-instance 'label-1))

   (setf (slot-1 l1) 5)

This works fine: whenever the last expression is called, the deamon prints
out his message. But as soon as I define another class

(defclass lab ()
   ((slot-1 :accessor slot-1 :initform 1)))


the deamon is not called anymore. It seems, that the reason is that
in the class lab there is also a slot named slot-1.
