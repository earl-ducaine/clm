Bugs
====

- Printing of documents is not yet fully implemented even though the
corresponding menu entries exist.

- Sometimes, the automounter on SUNs makes it impossible to reach a directory
with the finder. 

- In the bitmap-editor demo, when setting a new size for the bitmap, the
mini-view does not enlarge correctly. The correct size appears if you
resize the window through the window manager decoration. A similar hack
could be included in the code.

- If you want to disable the Motif 1.1 keyboard traversal feature, but
want to retain the ability to dismiss dialogs with the Return key, you
must disable traversal only for certain widget classes. For this
purpose, you can include the contents of "X-initfiles/traversal-defaults"
in your .Xdefaults.
